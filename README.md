# eco-sim
This is an ecological simulator about bunnies living on a tropical island. The bunnies have only a few desires. They want to eat (carrots), drink (water), sleep and copulate from time to time.

Each bunny has genetic characteristics (such as speed and sight). Every newborn baby bunny inherits these traits from either the mother or the father. Genes additionally have the possibility to mutate.

You can follow a bunny by clicking on it. There are also statistics where you can track the success of the entire population.
